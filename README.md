**PC Performance Logger** is my **first-ever project**! 🎉 As someone who isn't a professional programmer, I was amazed by how AI tools like ChatGPT helped me create this PowerShell script. It monitors and logs your PC's CPU and RAM usage per process and software, generating a beautiful HTML report for easy analysis. 📊✨

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pc-performance-logger.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

## 📋 Usage

Once the script is running, it will monitor your PC's CPU and RAM usage, logging the data at specified intervals. After collecting enough data, it generates an HTML report located in the `Reports` folder. 🗂️

### 🔧 Customize Logging Intervals

Edit the `$interval` variable in the script to set your desired logging frequency:

```powershell
$interval = 60 # Interval in seconds
```
